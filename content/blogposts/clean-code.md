Meaningful Names
----------------

* Use intention-revealing names
* Avoid Disinformation
* Make meaningful distinctions
* Use pronounceable names
* Use searchable names
* Avoid encodings
* Member prefixes (not use them -> instead use coloring)
* Interfaces and Implementations (Don't use I with interfaces instead postfix the implementation with 'Impl')
* Avoid mental mapping (smart vs professional programmer: CLARITY IS KING)
* Class names: classes and object should have noun or noun phrases, example Customer, WikiPage, AddressParser. Not Manager, Processor, Data
* Method names: methods should have verb or verb phrases, example postPayment, deletePage, save. 

* Don't be cute: don't be funny in code --> think about clarity
* Pick one word per concept
* Don't pun: avoid using the same name for 2 purposes
* Use solution domain names: 
* Use problem domain names
* Add Meaningful context
* Don't add gratuitous context: keep your names as short and meaningful as possible, don't add useless prefixes.
